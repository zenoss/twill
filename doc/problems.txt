Known Problems or Error Messages
================================

Problems posted to the twill mailing list (or sent to Titus personally)
will end up here if they are either outside the scope of twill, or
intractable within the context of the twill project!

Last updated Apr 2006.

1. inspect module masking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The error message ::

   AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'getmro'

is caused by masking of the default Python 'inspect' module with another
module named 'inspect'.  Known to happen in Webware installs.
(Reported by David Hancock.)

2. Empty 'textarea' form elements are filled with a newline by 'tidy'.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Specifically, ::

   <textarea></textarea>

is turned into ::

   <textarea>
   </textarea>

by tidy.  Set 'config use_tidy 0' to turn this off.  You can use ::

   <textarea />

to sneak an empty textarea through tidy.

(Reported by Gabor Farkas.)

3. Unicode support is still young.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's not yet clear how well mechanize and twill adhere to either the
official recommendations
(http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/charset.html) or the unofficial
recommendations (http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/htmlunicode.html) for
dealing with unicode.  There are definitely some problems in the version
of mechanize included with twill in 0.8.4; this should be resolved in
later releases.

4. Various kinds of broken HTML will break the form parser.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For example, twill (or, rather, ClientForm) sees no forms in this HTML ::

   <font>
   <INPUT type="this">

   <FORM>
   <input type="blah">
   </form>
