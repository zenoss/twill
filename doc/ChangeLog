	  with unnecessary newlines.

	* RELEASE 0.8.

	* Additional coverage and some miscellaneous fixes.

2005-11-28  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* Made http-equiv=refresh stuff work by overriding it in utils.py.
	  My fix is probably bad.  oh well, shouldn't make a difference...

2005-11-27  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* Verified that eggs stuff now "just works".

	* Put in a fix for an HTTP Basic Auth bug (that is fixed in Py 2.5!)

	* Added in a bunch of form tests to test-form, fixed bugs discovered
	  thereby.

	  LinksFactory.parser_class.

	  MechanizeBrowser.title().

	* Added 'utils.run_tidy' function & 'test-tidy.py' under tests/.

	* Moved the journey-exception-wrapping into the mechanize mech_open
	  function; this fixes a bug reported by sureshvv.  Augmented

2005-11-19  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

2005-11-18  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

2005-11-17  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* substantially updated README with links to other tools.

	* KeyboardInterrupts don't error out in twill-sh; they just force
	  a silent exit.

	* Added a code 500 test to 'test-http-codes'.

2005-11-15  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* Fixed failure to seek(0) before parsing response; problem
	  in _parse_html.  It broke 'back()' behavior for forms.
	  Added test-back.{py,twill}.
	
	* Test cleanup: add try: finally: around __main__ stuff, and
	  add 'initial_url' args.

	* Added 'advanced docs' section.

	* Added http_proxy documentation.

	* Fixed problems caused by failure to construct a valid
	  result object when HTTP errors (e.g. 404) happen.  Tested
	  by test-http-codes.py.

	* Added test-http-codes, cleaned up testlib a bit.

	* Fixed a stupid bug in parse.py with 'local_dict' != 'locals_dict'.

	* Added small section to README about 'nose' unit tests.

	* Cleaned up the 'myhttplib' WSGI intercept code & added a test.

2005-11-10  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	  moved 'twillserver.py' to 'twilltestserver.py', and fixed
	  it to run simple_server when executed from the command line.

	* Fixed two form submission bugs, pointed out by Mike Rovner.

2005-11-09  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* Added William Volkman's patch fixing 'agent'.

2005-11-06  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* Updated 'formvalue' and 'submit' help docs.

2005-11-05  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	  (James Cameron bug/fix)

2005-11-04  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	  unit tests!

2005-10-30  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* Now catch errors from __ and $ eval failure (i.e. not in any
	  namespace) and reset the evaluation to just be the original name.
	  (bug reported by sureshvv).

2005-10-29  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* Cleared content-type header in wwwsearch.zip, urllib2_support.py,
	  class HTTPRedirectHandler, redirect_request.  This fixes a bug
	  I noticed when testing collar: redirects inappropriately retain
	  content-type, and this breaks Quixote, at the least, when
	  enctype multipart/form-data is used in a POST prior to the
	  redirect.  (CTB: this should be dealt with more generally.)

	* Fixed back() behavior in _mechanize.  (I probably broke it in the
	  first place, sigh.)  Now accords with latest trunk _mechanize.py.

	* Fixed order of __url__ setting in parse.execute_command.

	* Added 'url' and 'exit' commands.

	* Added 'debug twill' to set printout of twill commands as they
	  are executed.

	* Attempted to add http_auth testing, but failed.  (non-functional
	  code left in test/)

	* Overrode 'view_html' bool function in PatchedMechanizeBrowser.
	  It now assumes that no content-type means text/html, and also
	  allows 'text/xml' to be used.  (James Cameron's issue.)

	* moved _TwillBrowserState into browser.py, named it TwillBrowser().

	* twill-sh now prints out the exception str when executing files,
	  even when 'fail' flag is not set.

2005-10-18  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* fixed bug in get_form_field that inverted the priorities of
	  form/field searches.

	* added documentation for add_auth, form/field identification.

2005-10-09  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* Added tv@debian.org's patch: add 'title' assertion,
	  and show error messages when TwillAssertions are caught.

2005-10-07  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* Updated to version 0.7.3 in the code; RELEASE.

	* Added 'twill-fork' script for stress-testing.

2005-10-01  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* Increased code coverage of tests by adding in a few commands
	  to test_twill.twill.

	* Added Robert Leftwich's patch to allow the use of ImageControl
	  for 'submit'.

2005-09-20  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* Added Nic Ferrier's patch to request text/html first.

2005-09-18  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* Switched to using eval for $variable substitution.

	* Created namespaces.py, moved local/global dictionary stuff in
	  there.  Created local namespace stack; namespaces now mean
	  something ;).

	* Added setglobal and setlocal, then agonized about local/global
	  dictionaries.

	* Added Ed Rahn's patch: run, runfile, and $variable substition.
	  Documented appropriately.

2005-09-10  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* Updated version to 0.7.2.  RELEASE.

	* Updated setup.py to contain full Pypi info & Trove classification.

	* Made sure current directory was in sys.path on load;
	  useful for extend_with!

	* Added debug http functionality.

	* Added save_html <filename>.

2005-09-03  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* Fixed extend_with to update the interactive shell.
	
2005-08-20  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* Updated pyparsing.py to 1.3.2.

2005-06-08  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* Added 'add_auth' command for HTTP basic authentication.

	* Added 'formfile' command for file uploads.

	* Added 'test/README.txt' for testing docs.

	* Applied Joeri van Ruth's patch to make '-' as a filename
	  read from stdin.

2005-06-06  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* Now checks for exact matches to fieldnames before trying out
	  regexps.

	* Submit w/o submit buttons now working.

	* Fixed quoted handling of __stuff__.

	* More intelligent pyparsing stuff from Paul McGuire; in particular,
	  comments on the ends of lines are allowed, and '#' in arguments
	  is disallowed.

2005-06-04  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* added a couple of command line options using 'optparse'.

	* added __url__ ==> current URL.

	* added some of Paul McGuire's suggestions for cleaning up the
	  pyparsing code.

	* better error reporting on all exceptions while executing
	  file.

	* Fixed a relative URL issue: twill now tries several URLs in order,
	  only prepending 'http://' when it's tried other URLs first.  Added
	  test.

	* Added Joeri van Ruth's patches: new sleep command, and transmit
	  value of submit buttons on form submission.  Added tests for the
	  latter.  Documented.

2005-05-26  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* all files specified on command-line now executed.

	* emacs backup files (filename~) now skipped by twill-sh.

	* error output on script execution now includes line number &
	filename.

2005-05-25  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* added reset_state; run it on each execute_file.

2005-05-24  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* 'go domainname' now works as expected.

	* Made various form-related submit() errors clearer.

	* Fixed problem with spaces in link *text*.  (Actually a more
	general bug that caused link searches to fail in most cases.)

2005-05-23  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* Fixed problem with spaces in links/URLs.
