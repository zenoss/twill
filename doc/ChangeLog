	* Now checks for exact matches to fieldnames before trying out
	  regexps.

	* Submit w/o submit buttons now working.

	  comments on the ends of lines are allowed, and '#' in arguments
	  is disallowed.

	* added some of Paul McGuire's suggestions for cleaning up the
	  pyparsing code.

	  only prepending 'http://' when it's tried other URLs first.  Added
	  test.

	  value of submit buttons on form submission.  Added tests for the
	  latter.  Documented.
