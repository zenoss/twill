	* added __url__ ==> current URL.

	* added some of Paul McGuire's suggestions for cleaning up the
	  pyparsing code.

	* better error reporting on all exceptions while executing
	  file.

	* Fixed a relative URL issue: twill now tries several URLs in order,
	  only prepending 'http://' when it's tried other URLs first.  Added
	  test.

	* Added Joeri van Ruth's patches: new sleep command, and transmit
	  value of submit buttons on form submission.  Added tests for the
	  latter.  Documented.

	* emacs backup files (filename~) now skipped by twill-sh.

	filename.

	* 'go domainname' now works as expected.

	* Made various form-related submit() errors clearer.

	* Fixed problem with spaces in link *text*.  (Actually a more
	general bug that caused link searches to fail in most cases.)
