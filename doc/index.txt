Acknowledgements
----------------

Cory Dodt had a great idea with PBP, and I thank him for his insight.
Ian Bicking gave me the idea of reimplementing PBP on top of IPython
(since abandoned in favor of cmd_), and suggested the "in-process"
hack.  Grig Gheorghiu was strangely enthusiastic about the simple demo
I showed him and has religiously promoted twill ever since.  John
J. Lee has promptly and enthusiastically checked in my various patches
to mechanize.  Michele Simionato is an early adopter who has helped
quite a bit.  Thanks, guys...

Bug reports have come in from the following fine people: Chris Miles,
MATSUNO Tokuhiro, Elvelind Grandin, Mike Rovner, sureshvv, Terry Peppers,
Kieran Holland, Alexander Shvedunov, Norman Khine, Leonardo Santagada,
Sebastien Pierre, Herve Cauwelier, aledain, Uy Do, David Hancock,
Tomi Hautakoski, T

Patches have been submitted by Joeri van Ruth, Paul McGuire, Ed Rahn,
Nic Ferrier, Robert Leftwich, James Cameron, William Volkman,
Tommi Virtanen, Simon Buenzli, sureshvv, Jeff Martin, Stephen
Thorne, and Bob Halley.
